A comprehensive GUI tool for Nintendo Switch NAND repair, designed to simplify complex recovery processes into a user-friendly, step-by-step interface.


NAND Fix Pro provides three distinct levels of repair, from a simple system file restore that preserves your data to a complete NAND reconstruction for catastrophic failures. It automates the use of essential community tools like **EmmcHaccGen**, **NxNandManager**, and **OSFMount** behind a clean and safe interface.

## Features

-   **Three-Tiered Repair System**: Choose the right level of repair for your specific issue.
-   **User-Friendly GUI**: A modern, dark-themed interface that guides you through every step. No command-line knowledge required.
-   **Automatic Path Detection**: The application automatically finds its required tools from the `lib` folder.
-   **Safety First**: Critical actions require user confirmation to prevent accidental data loss. Buttons remain disabled until all required files and paths are correctly configured.
-   **Erista & Mariko Support**: Automatically detects the console model from its PRODINFO and applies the correct settings for boot file generation.
-   **Automated Dependency Management**: The included launcher ensures Python and required libraries are installed automatically.
-   **Built-in Admin Elevation**: Automatically prompts for administrator rights, which are required for direct eMMC access.
-   **Robust Logging**: All operations are logged to the screen and saved in an `error_log.txt` on crash, making troubleshooting easy.
-   **Disk Space Validation**: Automatically checks for sufficient free space (60GB) before starting any repair process.

## The Three Levels of Repair

####  Level 1: System Restore (Data Preserved)
* **What it does**: Dumps the SYSTEM partition from your Switch, replaces the core OS files with clean ones generated from your firmware, and flashes it back.
* **When to use it**: Ideal for fixing boot issues caused by a failed system update, a bad custom theme, or general software corruption where your save games and installed titles are still intact.
* **Outcome**: Your console's OS is repaired, and all your user data (saves, games, profiles) is preserved.

####  Level 2: Full Rebuild (User Data Erased)
* **What it does**: Uses your Switch's unique PRODINFO to rebuild the entire NAND using clean, pre-packaged donor partitions.
* **When to use it**: Use this when multiple partitions (not just SYSTEM) are corrupt, but your console's PRODINFO is still readable and intact.
* **Outcome**: Your console is restored to a factory-like state. **All user data will be erased.**
* **New Advanced Option** - Fix USER Partition: This level now includes a separate, advanced function to repair only a corrupt USER partition without touching the rest of the OS. This is a faster alternative if your problem is isolated to user data corruption (e.g., being unable to boot past the setup screen). Like the full rebuild, this process will also erase all user data.

####  Level 3: Complete Recovery (Last Resort)
* **What it does**: Reconstructs a complete NAND from scratch using a **donor PRODINFO file** and a pre-built NAND skeleton. It automatically detects the eMMC size (32GB/64GB) to use the correct template.
* **When to use it**: This is the final option for a completely dead or lost NAND where even the original PRODINFO is gone or corrupt.
* **Outcome**: A brand new, functional NAND is written to the eMMC. **This is a total overwrite.**

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, you will need to provide:

1.  **Your Keys File**: A `prod.keys` file dumped from your own console.
2.  **Firmware Files**: A folder containing the extracted firmware for the version you wish to install.
3.  **(Level 3 Only)**: A decrypted donor `PRODINFO` file if your original is lost.

All other required tools and donor partitions are included in the release package.

## Installation & Windows Defender Notice

### Download and Extract

1. Download the `NAND-Fix-Pro-v2.0.0.exe` file from the [latest release page](https://github.com/sthetix/NANDFixPro/releases).
2. **Important**: The downloaded `.exe` file is actually a **7-Zip self-extracting archive**. When you run it or extract it, Windows Defender may flag the `NANDFixPro.exe` launcher as a potential threat.

### False Positive Warning

**This is a known false positive detection.** The `NANDFixPro.exe` launcher is flagged because it:
- Automatically elevates to administrator privileges
- Installs a portable Python environment
- Executes system-level operations required for eMMC access

The tool is completely safe and open-source. You can review the source code in this repository at any time.

### How to Exclude from Windows Defender

To use NAND Fix Pro, you'll need to add an exclusion to Windows Defender:

#### Method 1: Add Exclusion Before Extracting (Recommended)

1. Open **Windows Security** by searching for it in the Start menu
2. Click on **Virus & threat protection**
3. Under "Virus & threat protection settings", click **Manage settings**
4. Scroll down to **Exclusions** and click **Add or remove exclusions**
5. Click **Add an exclusion** and select **Folder**
6. Navigate to and select the folder where you plan to extract NAND Fix Pro
7. Now extract the `NAND-Fix-Pro-v2.0.0.exe` to that folder

#### Method 2: Restore Quarantined File

If Windows Defender already quarantined the file:

1. Open **Windows Security**
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**
3. Click on **Protection history**
4. Find the `NANDFixPro.exe` entry and click on it
5. Click **Actions** → **Restore**
6. Then follow **Method 1** above to add the folder to exclusions to prevent future detection

#### Method 3: Using Windows Defender via Settings

1. Press `Windows + I` to open Settings
2. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Windows Security**
3. Click **Virus & threat protection**
4. Under "Virus & threat protection settings", click **Manage settings**
5. Scroll to **Exclusions** → **Add or remove exclusions**
6. Click **Add an exclusion** → **Folder**
7. Select your NAND Fix Pro installation folder

## Usage

Getting started is designed to be as simple as possible.

### 1. Prepare Your Console and Files
* **CRITICAL: Create a full NAND backup using Hekate before doing anything else.** This is your essential safety net and must be done regardless of which repair level you plan to use. Without this backup, you cannot recover if something goes wrong.
* Get your unique console files. Use **Lockpick RCM** to dump your `prod.keys` file. **You must copy this file from your Switch's SD card to your computer**, as the tool needs it for all operations.
* If you're performing a **Level 3: Complete Recovery**, you will also need a decrypted **donor** `PRODINFO` file. If you used the `prodinfo_gen` tool to create one, **ensure you copy this file to your computer as well**.
* Prepare a USB cable to connect your Switch to your computer.

### 2. Connect and Configure with Hekate
* Boot your Switch into **Hekate**.
* Navigate to the **USB Tools** menu.
* Ensure the **"Read-only" option is disabled**. This will allow the tool to write to your eMMC.
* Select **eMMC RAW GPP**. This makes your Switch's eMMC accessible to your computer.

### 3. Run the Tool
* Download the `NAND-Fix-Pro-v1.0.0.zip` file from the [latest release page](https://github.com/sthetix/NANDFixPro/releases).
* Extract the entire contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
* Simply **double-click the `NANDFixPro.exe`** file.

The launcher will automatically perform a one-time setup:
- It will install an embedded, portable version of Python.
- It will install the necessary Python dependencies (`wmi`).
- It will then start the NAND Fix Pro application for you.

### 4. Flash the Generated Boot Files
* After the tool generates the new `boot0` and `boot1` files, you must flash them to your console.
* Copy the generated `boot0` and `boot1` files into the `backup/<your-emmc-id>/restore` folder on your Switch's SD card. The `<your-emmc-id>` is a unique alphanumeric ID based on your eMMC chip, for example, `e4ff5e48`.
* In Hekate, go to the **Tools** section. Select **Restore eMMC**, then choose **eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1** to flash these files back to your console.
